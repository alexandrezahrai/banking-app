#Banking App

### JavaScript, CSS, HTML

This is a personal banking app. It allows the user to log in with their unique credentials, manage their money, inititate bank transfers, and receive funds. I created this project to showcase my JavaScript and CSS potential. Please, take a look below for the login credentials.

#### Login credentials:
